# Testing Guide for Route Fixes

## What Was Changed

This PR fixes critical route case sensitivity issues that were causing broken navigation in the application.

### Routes Affected

1. `/OnboardingChat` → `/onboarding-chat` (changed)
2. `/PlannerWorkspace` → `/planner-workspace` (changed)
3. `/Auth` → `/auth` (changed)
4. `/Chat' → `/chat`
5. `/EmailVerification` → `/email-verification`
6. `/AuthRedirect` → `/auth-redirect`

## Testing Checklist

### 1. New User Signup Flow

**Steps:**

1. Go to `/auth`
2. Click "Sign Up" tab
3. Enter email and password
4. Submit the form
5. **Expected:** Redirected to `/email-verification` with email shown
6. Check your email for magic link
7. Click the link in the email
8. **Expected:** Redirected to `/auth-redirect` then to `/onboarding-chat`
9. Complete onboarding by providing engagement date and wedding date
10. Click "Go to Dashboard" or similar completion button
11. **Expected:** Successfully redirected to `/planner-workspace`

**What was broken before:** Step 8 and 11 would redirect to `/auth` instead due to case mismatch

### 2. Returning User Login Flow

**Steps:**

1. Go to `/auth`
2. Click "Login" tab
3. Enter existing user credentials
4. Submit the form
5. Check email for magic link
6. Click the link
7. **Expected:** Redirected to `/auth-redirect` then to `/planner-workspace`

**What was broken before:** Step 7 would redirect to `/auth` instead due to case mismatch

### 3. Chat to Dashboard Navigation

**Steps:**

1. Login as existing user
2. Navigate to `/chat`
3. Complete onboarding if prompted
4. Click "Dashboard" button or navigate to dashboard
5. **Expected:** Successfully loaded `/planner-workspace` page

**What was broken before:** Would redirect to `/auth` due to case mismatch

### 4. Direct URL Access

**Steps:**

1. While logged in, directly access these URLs in browser:
   - `/planner-workspace` - **Expected:** Planner Workspace page loads
   - `/onboarding-chat` - **Expected:** Onboarding page loads (or redirects to /chat if completed)
   - `/chat` - **Expected:** Chat page loads

**What was broken before:** `/planner-workspace` and `/onboarding-chat` would redirect to `/auth`

### 5. Invalid URL Handling

**Steps:**

1. Try accessing invalid URLs:
   - `/PlannerWorkspace` (old PascalCase) - **Expected:** Redirects to `/auth`
   - `/OnboardingChat` (old PascalCase) - **Expected:** Redirects to `/auth`
   - `/random-path` - **Expected:** Redirects to `/auth`

### 6. Email Verification Flow

**Steps:**

1. Start new signup at `/auth`
2. Submit email/password
3. **Expected:** Redirected to `/email-verification` (not `/EmailVerification`)
4. Click "← Back to login"
5. **Expected:** Returns to `/auth`

## Known Issues Before This Fix

### Issue 1: Dashboard Unreachable

**Symptom:** After completing onboarding, users were redirected back to `/auth` instead of dashboard
**Cause:** Navigation called `/planner-workspace` but route was defined as `/PlannerWorkspace`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Onboarding Navigation Broken

**Symptom:** Users couldn't access onboarding after email verification
**Cause:** Navigation called `/onboarding-chat` but route was defined as `/OnboardingChat`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 3: Email Verification Redirect Failed

**Symptom:** After submitting credentials, redirect to email verification failed
**Cause:** Navigation called `/EmailVerification` but route was defined as `/email-verification`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Developer Notes

### New Route Constants

A constants file has been created at `src/constants/routes.ts`:

```typescript
export const ROUTES = {
  AUTH: '/auth',
  ONBOARDING_CHAT: '/onboarding-chat',
  CHAT: '/chat',
  PLANNER_WORKSPACE: '/planner-workspace'
  EMAIL_VERIFICATION: '/email-verification',
  AUTH_REDIRECT: '/auth-redirect',
} as const;
```

**Recommendation:** Future navigation calls should import and use these constants:

```typescript
import { ROUTES } from '@/constants/routes';
navigate(ROUTES.DASHBOARD); // Type-safe, prevents typos
```

### Files Modified

1. `src/App.tsx` - Route definitions and Navigate components
2. `src/pages/Auth.tsx` - Email verification navigation
3. `src/pages/EmailVerification.tsx` - Back to auth navigation
4. `src/constants/routes.ts` - New constants file

## Regression Risks

**Low Risk Changes:**

- Route paths are now consistent with existing navigation calls
- No business logic changed
- No API endpoints modified
- No database queries changed

**What to Watch:**

- Any custom browser bookmarks users may have saved with old PascalCase routes will now redirect to `/auth` (this is expected behavior for invalid routes)
- Third-party links to specific pages with old casing will also redirect (acceptable)

## Success Criteria

✅ All user flows complete successfully
✅ No unexpected redirects to `/auth`
✅ Direct URL navigation works for all valid routes
✅ Invalid routes properly redirect to `/auth`
✅ No console errors related to routing
✅ Build and lint pass without new errors
